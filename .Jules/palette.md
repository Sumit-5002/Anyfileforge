## 2025-05-14 - [Accessibility Enhancement for File Uploaders]
**Learning:** Component-based file uploaders often overlook the keyboard accessibility of the drag-and-drop zone itself. By adding `role="button"` and `tabIndex={0}`, we allow users to "click" the drop zone with Space/Enter, making it discoverable and usable for keyboard-only users. Additionally, hidden inputs used for file selection should always have descriptive `aria-label`s that reflect the specific action (e.g., "Select PDF files" vs just "Select files").
**Action:** Always ensure large click/drop targets have semantic roles and keyboard listeners. Use dynamic ARIA labels for file inputs to provide context about what types of files are expected.
