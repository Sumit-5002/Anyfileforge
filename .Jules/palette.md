## 2025-01-24 - [Semantic File Dropzones]
**Learning:** Converting file dropzones from `div` to `<button>` significantly improves accessibility but requires careful handling of nested `<input>` elements. Since `<button>` cannot contain other interactive elements like `<input>`, the file input must be a sibling, not a child. This ensures the component is natively focusable and responds correctly to keyboard interactions (Enter/Space) without manual event listeners.
**Action:** Always move `<input type="file">` to be a sibling of the trigger `<button>` and use `aria-label` for context while hiding the input from screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`.
